Interpolation is basicly can be described as a process of finding an estimated data from the
data which have known. Interpolation is also called resampling and is also the method to
increase or decrease the number of pixels in a digital image. The image interpolation
operation covers a broad range of interpolation techniques that apply to different types of
data. Interpolation methods can be used for different kind of applications. These examples can
be listed of zoom, shrink, rotate, geometric correction, digital image correction, image
warping, chromatic aberration correction. There are some interpolation methods for listed
applications:

1-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
2-Bilinear Algorithm


3 channel 32bit images and 8 bit single channel images are used as inputs!
The codes are written in C++ on MSVS 2015! 
You need to have OpenCV libraries and configure your compiler for dependencies.!
