Image processing is commonly used to aid the analysis of biomedical images. This includes preprocessing the images for better visibility, or full automatization of the procedure. In this homework, you are going to write a function that returns the number of cells in an image.

This code has no obvious answer to the count. The code is optimized to the closest count cell.
You can try different tecniques and approaches to get better results.
In this code below algorithms are used:
1-Gaussian Blur for getting image median
2- Erode & Dilate Function to seperate different cells (These functions need a specific structutal elements.You can check detailed version from OpenCV Docs.)
3- Connected Component Functions
4- Centroids
